**Kariminf Infomation Miner**

Was, first, designed as a parser to extract information from [Jim Breen's Edict2 dictionary](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict_doc.html).  
But, why not create a global project and extend this one with a wider vision:
* Create parsers for all sort of dictionaries and files
* Save the extracted information in a database (current sqlite)
